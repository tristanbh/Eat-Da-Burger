Eat Da Burger Homework Application

This application was created as part of my Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp curriculum.

Eat-Da-Burger is a web-app that has been deployed on heroku at this address:

https://glacial-crag-14341.herokuapp.com/

The application uses a mySQL databse, on heroku this is deployed via JAWS DB.

The user is able to add, "Burgers" to the database as well as change the state of the Burger. If a burger is, "Devoured" it will then show up in the right side column.
